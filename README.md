List Winodws tray icons

Have you ever wondered about those icons in your taskbar? Where they came from? Who put them there?

Some of them behave nicely (have a clear context menu which relates them to their owning process),
but some don't and just sit there, while you sit there wondering who ever added them.

Now you can just run this program and get all the information about those icons and their owning processes
